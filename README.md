<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## To Run

Clone this repo and run it with any decent Java IDE

## Usage

The game loads directly into the first level saved in levels/ as level0.dat interacting with red doors will take you to the next "level" and yellow doors are temporary barricades.
The levels can be edited by pressing 'y' which will bring up the level editor.
